Readme file for SQDFT 

  SQDFT is a code for performing high-temperature Born-Oppenheimer Quantum Molecular Dynamics 
  (QMD) in the framework of Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (DFT).

(1) External Libraries:
    SQDFT uses the following external library:
     (a) MVAPICH2 2.1, http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/news/
    The code has been tested using mvapich2/2.1 and intel/15.0 compilers, openmpi/1.8 and 
	gcc/4.9.0, and IBM mpicxx-4.7.2. 

(2) Compilation:
    SQDFT can be compiled from within the "SQDFT" folder using the commands: 

      make clean
      make

    A successful compilation will lead to the creation of the executable "SQDFT/lib/sqdft"

(3) Input files:
    SQDFT requires the following files as input:
     (a) ".input"  - User options and parameters.
     (b) ".atoms"  - Atomic information.
    In addition, SQDFT requires Troullier-Martins pseudopotential files as generated by the 
    code "atom" (http://bohr.inesc-mn.pt/~jlm/pseudo.html). 

(4) Execution:
    SQDFT can be executed in parallel using the "mpirun" command. Sample PBS script files are
    available in "SQDFT/tests" folder. The ".input" and ".atoms" input files should be present 
	in the root folder, and the corresponding pseudopotential files in the "./pseudopotential" 
	subfolder. Example input files can be found in the "SQDFT/tests" folder.
        
    Example: To run a simulation on 8 processors with input files as "filename1.input" and 
	"filename2.atoms", use the following command:
  
    mpirun -np 8 ./lib/sqdft -name filename1

(5) User Guide:
    Please refer to the SQDFT User Guide ("SQDFTUserGuide.pdf" provided in "SQDFT/doc" subfolder) for
    more information on input and output files contents.

(6) Tests: 
    The "SQDFT/tests" folder contains two tests:
     (a) Al
     (b) LiH
    These tests can be executed using the mpirun command as described above. The alternative is to
    use the PBS script files that have been provided. The energies and forces in the resulting 
    output files should be compared with the reference output files: results_Al and results_LiH 
	given in Al and LiH tests folders, respectively. Note that all simulations should be executed
	from the root folder.
